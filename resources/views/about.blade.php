About Alerio Technology Group

Alerio Technology Group is a Colorado-based managed service provider dedicated to delivering modern, secure, and dependable technology solutions for schools and small to mid-sized businesses. For more than a decade, we’ve helped organizations strengthen their IT foundations, improve operational efficiency, and protect the people they serve. While technology is our craft, our purpose is bigger: we exist to make schools and communities safer, stronger, and better connected through thoughtful, innovative solutions built around real human needs.

We believe that great IT isn’t just about equipment or infrastructure—it’s about partnership. Our clients trust us because we listen first, understand their challenges, and design solutions that fit their unique environment. Many of our new relationships begin with personal referrals, and we work hard to honor that trust by delivering service that is reliable, responsive, and rooted in integrity. When someone recommends Alerio, we take that personally—and we strive to show every new connection why their confidence in us is well placed.

A Mission Grounded in Safety and Service

Alerio is especially passionate about supporting K–12 schools, where technology plays a critical role in both learning and safety. We partner closely with school administrators, safety teams, and district leaders to design and maintain the systems that protect campuses every day. This includes secure networks, resilient communication systems, emergency-ready public address (PA) systems, visitor management solutions, and integrated life safety technologies. As parents, community members, and technologists, we understand that the safety of students and staff is non-negotiable—so we treat every school project with the care and urgency it deserves.

We bring that same level of commitment to our business clients. Whether we’re managing day-to-day IT operations, migrating critical systems to the cloud, or deploying secure collaboration platforms, our goal is consistent: help organizations operate confidently and securely in a constantly evolving digital landscape.

Technical Expertise With a Human Touch

Our team is composed of engineers and specialists with deep experience across IT infrastructure, cloud services, communications, physical security, and emerging cybersecurity practices. Though highly skilled, we remain approachable, patient, and committed to education. We speak your language—whether you’re a superintendent, a business owner, or an IT coordinator—and we ensure every solution not only works flawlessly but makes sense for your team, your workflows, and your long-term goals.

Alerio takes pride in offering a streamlined, unified approach to technology. Instead of juggling multiple vendors, our clients rely on us as a single trusted partner for:
•	Managed IT Services & Infrastructure
•	Cybersecurity Solutions (rapidly expanding)
•	Cloud Hosting & Virtualization
•	Phone & Unified Communications Systems
•	Public Address & Emergency Notification
•	Premise Security, Access Control & Surveillance

Innovating Forward: Our Commitment to Cybersecurity

As threats grow more complex, Alerio is expanding aggressively into advanced cybersecurity services. Our goal is to provide the same dependable, approachable expertise we’re known for, while equipping clients with stronger defenses, better visibility, and safer digital environments. From threat monitoring and endpoint protection to secure identity systems and compliance support, our cybersecurity practice is becoming a core part of how we deliver value.

This evolution reflects our belief that safety today requires protecting both the physical and digital layers of every organization—and we are committed to partnering with our clients to strengthen both.
